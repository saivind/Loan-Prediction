# Loan-Status-Prediction

Hi, this project is to predict, whether any request for a loan, will be approved or not, simply by the use of machine learning.

Any bank, approves a loan based on the two most vital points:

1) How risky is the borrower currently, (This is the factor, on which the interest rate of the borrower will depend), and

2) Should they lend the money to the borrower at the given risks?

If both of these conditions give an affirmatory result, the bank proceeds with the loan approval.

We determine whether the loan is processesed based on Machine Learning algorithms like 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear SVC ( Linear Support Vector Classification)
3. Navie Bayes
4. Gradient Boosting Trees
5. Random Forest
6. KNN
7. Stochastic Gradient Descent
8. Decison Tree

I evaluated the models using F1 Score and Cross-Validation Score.
